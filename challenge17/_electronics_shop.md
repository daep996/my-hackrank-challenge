A person wants to determine the most expensive computer keyboard and USB drive that can be purchased with a give budget. Given price lists for keyboards and USB drives and a budget, find the cost to buy them. If it is not possible to buy both items, return **-1**.

**Example**
```
b = 60
keyboards = [40, 50, 60]
drivers = [5, 8, 12]
```
The person can buy a **40 keyboard + 12 USB drive = 52**, or a **50 keyboard + 8 USB drive = 58**. Choose the latter as the more expensive option and return **58**.

**Function Description**

Complete the getMoneySpent function in the editor below.

getMoneySpent has the following parameter(s):

- int keyboards[n]: the keyboard prices
- int drives[m]: the drive prices
- int b: the budget

**Returns**

- int: the maximum that can be spent, or **-1** if it is not possible to buy both items

**Input Format**

The first line contains three space-separated integers **b**, **n**, and **m**, the budget, the number of keyboard models and the number of USB drive models.

The second line contains **n** space-separated integers **keyboard[i]**, the prices of each keyboard model.

The third line contains **m** space-separated integers **drives**, the prices of the USB drives.

**Constraints**

- 1 <= n, m <= 1000
- 1 <= b <= 10⁶
- The price of each item is in the inclusive range **[1, 10⁶]**.

**Sample Input 0**
```
10 2 3
3 1
5 2 8
```

**Sample Output 0**
```
9
```

**Explanation 0**

Buy the 2^nd keyboard and the 3^rd USB drive for a total cost of **8 + 1 = 9**.

**Sample Input 1**
```
5 1 1
4
5
```

**Sample Output 1**
```
-1
```

**Explanation 1**

There is no way to buy one keyboard and one USB drive because **4 + 5 > 5**, so return **-1**.
